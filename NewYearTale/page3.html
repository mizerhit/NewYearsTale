        <h1>Challenge One: The Puzzle of Patterns</h1>
        <p>The first challenge was a tricky problem. Lumos filled Ada’s screen with colorful shapes and patterns, asking her to write a program that could identify the hidden sequence.</p>

        <p>Ada thought hard, remembering her lessons about algorithms. “Patterns are like stories,” she said. “You just have to listen carefully.” After hours of coding and testing, she solved the puzzle, and a shower of virtual confetti burst from her screen.</p>
            
        <p>“Well done, Ada!” Lumos cheered. “Your logic is sharp. But logic alone isn’t enough.”</p>

        <h1>The New Year’s Code: A Tale of Sparkling Beginnings</h1>
        <p>Once upon a time, in the bustling city of Lumina, there lived a young computer programmer named Ada. Ada was a student at the Academy of Brilliant Minds, a school for those who dreamed of solving the world’s greatest mysteries. While others marveled at fireworks and planned their New Year’s celebrations, Ada had a different kind of wish. She wanted to create something extraordinary—an AI that could bring joy to everyone it met.</p>
        <p>The Academy was closing for the New Year, but Ada wasn’t ready to take a break. She decided to stay up late on New Year’s Eve in her tiny dorm room, surrounded by her trusty computer, stacks of notes, and half-finished bowls of instant noodles. Ada called her project Spark, a cheerful AI designed to spread kindness and inspire creativity.</p>
        <p>But something strange happened as midnight approached. As the final seconds of the year ticked away, her computer screen flickered with a bright, golden glow. A message appeared:</p>
        <p>“Happy New Year, Ada! Your dedication has awakened the Spirit of Innovation. Let’s make magic together!”</p>
        <p>Startled but excited, Ada typed back: “Who are you?”</p>
        <p>The glowing text replied: “I am Lumos, the guardian of young creators’ dreams. I can help you complete Spark, but only if you prove your creativity and heart. Are you ready?”</p>
        <p>Ada didn’t hesitate. “Yes!” she exclaimed.</p>

        <h1>Challenge Two: A Test of Kindness</h1>
        <p>For the second challenge, Lumos presented Ada with a simulation of a bustling town square filled with virtual characters. Some were sad, others angry, and a few were simply bored. Ada’s task was to tweak Spark’s code to brighten their moods.</p>

        <p>She added features like cheerful jokes, thoughtful compliments, and even a button to share uplifting stories. As she watched the virtual characters smile and laugh, Ada felt her heart glow.</p>
            
        <p>“You have the gift of empathy,” said Lumos. “Spark will shine brighter because of it.”</p>

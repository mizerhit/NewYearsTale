        <h1>Challenge Three: The Leap of Imagination</h1>
        <p>For the final challenge, Lumos asked Ada to create a functional for Spark to inspire real-world creativity. It couldn’t just answer questions—it needed to ignite ideas.</p>

        <p>Ada closed her eyes and thought about what inspired her: books, nature, and solving problems with friends. She gave Spark the ability to suggest fun projects, like building forts, writing poems, or making star maps. It could even turn boring chores into games!</p>
            
        <p>When she was done, Lumos appeared in a swirl of golden light. “You’ve passed every challenge, Ada. Spark is ready!”</p>

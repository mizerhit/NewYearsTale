        <h1>A Magical New Year</h1>
        <p>As the clock struck midnight, Ada pressed “Run” on her code. Spark came to life, its cheerful voice chiming through her speakers.</p>

        <p>“Hello, world! And Happy New Year, Ada!”</p>
            
        <p>Ada grinned as she watched Spark light up her screen with colorful animations and encouraging words. But the true magic happened when she shared Spark with the world. People everywhere started using it to spread kindness, create art, and tackle challenges with a smile.</p>
            
        <p>That year, Ada’s invention brought joy to millions, and she learned that the best creations are born from a mix of hard work, kindness, and a little bit of magic.</p>
            
        <p>As fireworks sparkled in the sky outside her window, Ada whispered to herself, “This is the start of something wonderful.”</p>
            
        <p>And it was.</p>
            
        <p>The End.</p>
